You need latex to generate the pdf file. The simplest way to get latex is to use Overleaf.

* Sign up at overleaf.com
* Once you have logged in, copy and paste the contents of `cv_anil.tex` into text window
* Click on compile, that should generate the PDF

Once this works, just read the .tex file to see how text in the .tex file gets converted into .pdf file. Edit the text content to make it work for you.
